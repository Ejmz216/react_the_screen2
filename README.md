# The Screen V2.0

This project is a new version of The Screen, a Single Page Application initially created with VanillaJS, HTML5, and CSS3.

This time, I have opted to completely update (remake) the application using ReactJS and the well-known organization and best practices method "Atomic Design". Additionally, I will completely change the style and add new functionalities in the future, such as user registration and actor search.

In this post, I will include commit-to-commit documentation of the entire project process, using ChatGPT-3 to streamline the process. It is important to note that, as this is a practice project in ReactJS, there may be drastic changes between each update. However, I have decided to do it this way to document my process and help the reader (myself) in future implementations with similar functionalities (and to avoid making the same mistakes by forgetting certain algorithms).
